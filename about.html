                            <p>My name is Frederic Pun, your typical 19 year old pursuing his interest in the field of computer science - fueled by my curiousity in the field, comes from my fascination with technology and it's endless, growing capabilities that seems to now be incorporated into everything in every way possible. With that goal in mind, I worked my way continue and pursue my studies in Canada, at one of the best university around, The University of Toronto Scaborough.

                            <p>During my time at my highschool, there was no computer science courses, much less anything focused on coding. Hence, with a goal in mind to pursue computer science, I went out and took a Java course which exposed me to the world of Computer Science - So I thought. From there on, from all the oportunities and studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough, I realized that I've only scratched the surface and found myself anew as I indulge myself into the world of Computer Science.

                            <p>As of now, I have decided to settle with front-end web development, where I am currently focused on mobile friendly websites, as well as consistency and cross platform/device compatibility as I refine my skills in this field from self learning and participation in hackathons. I hope that in the future, also to get into back-end development using php and also MySQL databases, as well as popular and mainstream tools like Angularjs, Nodejs, etc.</p>

                            <p>Being an international student, I was thankful to have the opportunity to travel to places in the world, like China, Korea, Malaysia, etc. - be it for an event representing my school or the government, or leisure. In either leisure or work trip, from the trip I was able to gain experience academically from the event and/or socially as we explore the world to expand our horizons.
